    "<b> Background, overview and motivation: </b>\n",
    "Tech-related jobs has been booming when technology went mainstream, especially data scientist role.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Glassdoor 2022, data scientist rank the top 3 best job in America for 7 years running. This ranking is based on the career opportunites rating, number of opening jobs, and the average salaries. The median base salary is $120,000. The job opening were also spiking up from 1,736 in 2016 to 10,071 in 2022. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the ecosystem does not depend on just data scientist alone, it involves upstream and downstream job roles - like product/project managers and software engineers. These jobs are equally important to ensure the democratization of technology to average users. Hence, many people flocked to tech industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the compensation structure vary from one company to another, and was not accessible equally to everyone. [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) was started to democratize the access of information to compensation structure across tech jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*We want to expand this effort by creating an AI model (and subsequently a web app) that enable users to know the estimated annual compensation based on user inputs like year, company, level, title, location, years of experience, years at company and gender.*\n",
    "\n",

    "<b> Business objective: </b>\n",
    "To predict the annual salary (including base pay, stock grants and estimated bonuses) for data science and STEM roles using data from [LEVELS.FYI](https://www.levels.fyi/).\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "<b> Business success criteria: </b> \n",
    "A web app that enables user to know the annual compensation based on their input like year, company, level, title, location, years of experience, years at company and gender. and for the next 5 years\n",

    "This paper study predict the salary of IT jobs using data from Tecnoempleo, an e-Recruitment website. The result shows that experience, job stability or certain roles contribute significantly to the salary. Besides, decision trees yield a bettery accuracy (84%) than voting committe based tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> 2. Improving students' motivation to study using salary prediction system </b> <br>\n",
    "This paper proposes a salary prediction system for increasing students' motivation in studying. A decision tree technique is used to generate a prediction model with seven features.The result shows that the system can effectively boost students' motivation in studying and also show them a positive viewpoint of their future.\n",

    "In this paper an attempt has been made to develop a quantitative approach for predicting the factors that affect the salary of an individual. The Aspiring Minds’ Employability Outcomes (AMEO-2015) dataset consisting of Aspiring Minds’ Computer Adaptive Test (AMCAT) score along with job seeker personal and employment details of Indian students has been considered for the study. In order to analyze the effect of more than one independent variable on dependent variable multiple linear regression models has been applied. The model has been used on the training data to predict dependent variables and to extract features with highest impact on salary prediction.\n"
